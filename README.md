# PHP CodeSniffer GitHub Action

This action will help you to run phpcs (PHP_CodeSniffer) with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) platform. It also supports [annotations](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-status-checks#checks) out of the box â€” you don't need to use any tokens to make it work.

## Usage

Add the following code to `.github/workflows/phpcs.yml` file.

```yaml
name: PHPCS check

on: pull_request

jobs:
  phpcs:
      name: PHPCS
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
        - uses: actions/checkout@v2
        - name: PHPCS check
          uses: chekalsky/phpcs-action@v1
            with:
              dir: ./path/to/code
```

Eventually you could also check for warnings.

```yaml
        ...
        - name: PHPCS check
          uses: chekalsky/phpcs-action@v1
          with:
            dir: ./path/to/code
            enable_warnings: true
```

If you want to run a custom phpcs instance, you can define the path to the binary like the following:

```yaml
        ...
        - name: Install dependencies
          run: composer install --dev --prefer-dist --no-progress --no-suggest
        - name: PHPCS check
          uses: chekalsky/phpcs-action@v1
          with:
            dir: ./path/to/code
            phpcs_bin_path: './vendor/bin/phpcs'
```

If you like to define a custom code standard:

 ```yaml
         ...
         - name: Install dependencies
           run: composer install --dev --prefer-dist --no-progress --no-suggest
         - name: PHPCS check
           uses: chekalsky/phpcs-action@v1
           with:
             dir: ./path/to/code
             standard: ./path/to/standard
 ```
